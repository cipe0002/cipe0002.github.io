    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p1>
        Hi, my name is Enissa Ciper. I am in the IMD program for the spring term at Algonquin College. I live in Ottawa for almost 4 years now. I chose this program beacuse I have drawing skills and, I wanted to be on a field where I can gain new skills, and improve the ones I already have also, to have kind of an experience and challenge myself.
    
        It is my first time ever taking Responsive Web Design course or learning coding. I kind of find it hard but I hope I will be improving myself in the class and during this spring term. I truly wished it was in person instead of the online education because, I believe I learn better in person. But I am looking forward to spend rest of the semmester online and, get as much as knowledge I can.

       <h4>Motivational Quotation</h4>
       My favorite motovational quotation is;
       <blockquote>
          <b> Everything happens for a reason. <cite>- Hegel</cite></b>
        </blockquote>
        <p2>
           I have heard this almost my whole life from my family and friends and I think it motivates me a lot when I go through tough times. It reminds me that everything happens for a reason even the bad things and it leads you to a different path, even a better path for the long run. You just gotta keep pushing and know that when a door closes, a new door opens. The strong person you have become today is, because of the hard times you have gone through and it made you a stronger person.
